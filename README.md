## Hands-on Walkthrough

### Introduction

Plugins add functionality to WordPress sites, including things like contact forms, Search Engine Optimization, automatic backups, and pretty much anything you might need to add to your site. There are some plugins that most sites would benefit from installing. Common plugins add the following functionality to WordPress sites:

*   Contact Form
*   Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
*   Caching
*   Backup
*   Social Media
*   Analytics
*   Security

There is no limit to the number of plugins that can be installed on one website and having many active plugins does not have to slow your site down if they are well-built and play well with others. It is worth noting that while all of the plugins mentioned are free, they may have a "premium" version available at a cost. This is common for plugins to offer a free version and then sell a premium version that has more advanced functionality.

### Contact Form

Contact forms provide a way for users to send messages without having to use an email client. In fact, you don't have to make your email address public at all! There are many good contact form plugins available on [wordpress.org/plugins/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/), including [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/), which is great for simple messaging, and [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/), which allows for more complex types of information to be added before sending. [tip]Some of the advantages of using the contact form over e-mail address are:

*   Permits the user to stay on the same page.
*   Doesn’t require a user to log into their email account, which is common case if they are using a public or friend's computer.
*   Can be set to send notifications to different emails addresses depending on the form’s subject.
*   May benefit of a browser’s autofill function.

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

WordPress plays well with search engines out of the box, but adding an SEO plugin can help focus your efforts and help make your site visible to search engine crawlers. [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) are two of the most popular. They include the ability to add keywords and meta data to help you control how your site is found, as well as rate SEO for specific posts and pages.

### Caching

The speed at which your site loads is important to your visitors, and it's even more important to search engines. Caching is a way to speed up your website by storing parts of it on a visitor's computer, or creating lighter versions of the page to send to users. Some hosting providers include caching as part of their services, but if yours doesn't you'll want to include a caching plugin to help speed things up. [W3 Total Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/) and [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) are two of the most popular plugins to help you do this.

### Backups

Backing up a WordPress site involves two parts: backing up the files and backing up the database. You'll need to have both covered to have a full backup of your site. Good practice and something to look for in a plugin is saving backup files to a location other than your web server. [Duplicator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/) provides full database and files backup capability while [WP Migrate DB](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/) focuses on just the database which can be helpful when you want to keep site content up-to-date while redesigning a site. It is a wise to practice backing up your site and restoring it from a backup. A backup is not useful if the restore process does not work or if you do not know how to restore it when needed. Planning ahead is key with backups.

### Social Media

Social Media icons and share is a common request for websites, and there are tons of plugins to help you get the job done. A plugin such as [Social Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/social-icons/) or  [Lightweight Social Icons](https://wordpress.org/plugins/lightweight-social-icons/) allows you to add them to any widget area. A plugin such as [ShareThis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/share-this/) or the [Floating Social Bar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/floating-social-bar/) helps people share your content across social networks.

### Analytics

Tracking the traffic to your site is both fun and informative. Adding a plugin can display the information right on the dashboard. [Google Analytics Dashboard for WP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analytics-dashboard-for-wp/) or [Google Analyticator](https://wordpress.org/plugins/google-analyticator/) provide a wide range of information for analysis.

### Security

Providing security for all your websites is important. Security is a multi-faceted effort that may require more than one plugin. A plugin to combat comment spam ([Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/)) is included in the default WordPress install. A plugin to prevent malware and hacks, such as [Wordfence](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/) or [Sucuri Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/), should also be included.
